# Robot Arm Controller

## Overview
The **Robot Arm Controller** is a Unity-based application that allows users to control a simple robot arm using sliders and a randomization button. The arm consists of a base joint, a shoulder joint, and an arm joint, each of which can be manipulated to simulate various poses. This project demonstrates basic principles of Unity scripting, UI interaction, and robot kinematics.

## Features
- Control the base joint rotation using a slider.
- Adjust the shoulder and arm joint angles using sliders.
- Randomize the robot arm's pose to various valid configurations with a button.
- User-friendly UI for easy interaction with the robot arm.
  
## Requirements
- Unity 2020.3 or later
- Basic understanding of Unity's UI system and C# scripting.

## Usage
Running the Application: Press the Play button in Unity to run the application.
Controlling the Robot Arm:
Use the sliders to adjust the angles of the shoulder, arm, and base joints.
Click the "Randomize Pose" button to set the robot arm to a random valid pose within the defined constraints.

## Code Structure
RobotArmController.cs: The main script that handles the robot arm's movement and UI interactions.
